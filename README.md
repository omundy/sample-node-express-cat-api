## Start the application

To start your app...

1. Run: `npm start`
1. Check that your app is running <http://localhost:3000/>

To use Nodemon to watch and restart your app when you update files:

- Start in development mode with nodemon: `npm run start-dev`
- Start in development mode with nodemon (requires a key and certificate): `npm run start-https`


## Add a üçï Favicon

To add an emoji favicon...

1. Visit this page https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/
1. Select your emoji
1. Download and unzip the files and place them in the `public/` directory
1. Add the correct meta tags to the `<head>` of the main handlebars layout file [`views/layouts/main.hbs`](views/layouts/main.hbs)






## Heroku Instructions

### Heroku Setup

These steps explain how to publish your node app to the web with Heroku. Before you begin you'll need to...

1. Create a [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) account
2. Download and install heroku-cli using these [multi-platform instructions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)
3. Verify the heroku-cli is installed: `heroku --version`
4. Login to Heroku: `heroku login` (prompts browser login) or `heroku login -i` (prompts CLI login)



### Project Setup

For every project you publish...

1. Add a [`Procfile`](Procfile) to the root directory
2. Create a heroku app and (optionally) name it (don't include the `<` or `>`)

```bash
heroku create <unique-app-name>
```
3. Check that git now has another remote repository (in addition to Github)

```bash
git remote -v
# you should see something like
# heroku	https://git.heroku.com/sample-node-express-template.git (fetch)
# heroku	https://git.heroku.com/sample-node-express-template.git (push)
# origin	https://github.com/omundy/sample-node-express-template.git (fetch)
# origin	https://github.com/omundy/sample-node-express-template.git (push)
```


### Publish Your Project

4. Perform these steps [to update Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git). This reinstalls dependencies and restarts your app on Heroku.

```bash
# commit your code and push it to Heroku
git add .
git commit -m "Heroku Hello World"
git push heroku main
```

5. Assign a single web dyno (basically a server) to run the app. This command starts your app after you have deployed above. Run this just once because every time you `git push` (step 4) Heroku will restart your app.
```bash
heroku ps:scale web=1
```

6. Open your site using `heroku open` or go to https://name-of-your-app.herokuapp.com/
7. If something isn't working correctly you can [view the server logs with](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli-commands): `heroku logs --tail`
